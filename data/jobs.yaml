- title: Postdoctoral Research Professional – Dynamic Thermal Rating & DER Analytics
  type: Postdoctoral Fellow
  project: Real-Time DTR & DER-Analytics Platform for NB Power
  start_date: January 5, 2026
  deadline: Open until filled; review begins February 2026
  funding: ResearchNB Research Professional Fund
  open: false
  
  description: |
    The Emera & NB Power Research Center for Smart Grid Technologies at UNB invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Professional to lead the development, testing, and operationalization of a Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) and DER-analytics platform in partnership with NB Power.
    <br><br>
    This position is funded by ResearchNB's Research Professional Fund and offers a unique opportunity to advance technology from TRL 5 to TRL 7 while working directly with utility engineers and operational systems.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Project Overview</strong><br>
    New Brunswick's energy strategy calls for a five-fold increase in wind and solar capacity by 2035. This project addresses a critical barrier: the stress on aging transmission infrastructure from rapid DER growth. Dynamic Thermal Rating can unlock 15–30% additional capacity on existing lines when weather conditions permit, reducing renewable curtailment and deferring costly grid rebuilds. You will convert an existing academic prototype into a robust, production-ready solution integrated with NB Power's operational systems.
