**🔋 Postdoctoral Research Professional – Dynamic Thermal Rating & DER Analytics**

**University of New Brunswick | Fredericton, NB, Canada**

We are seeking a **Postdoctoral Research Professional** to join the Emera & NB Power Research Center for Smart Grid Technologies at UNB. This 12-month position (starting January 2026) offers a unique opportunity to bridge academic innovation with utility-scale implementation.

**The Project:**
You will lead the development of a cloud-based Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) and DER-analytics platform in direct partnership with NB Power. The goal: unlock 15–30% latent transmission capacity to support New Brunswick's ambitious target of adding 1,600 MW of wind and solar by 2035.

**What You'll Do:**
• Develop hybrid IEEE-738/ML models for real-time conductor temperature prediction
• Build production-grade micro-services with CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes deployment
• Lead 3-month field pilots on two 138 kV transmission corridors
• Mentor graduate and undergraduate students in DevOps and utility data standards
• Translate research into practice through operator training and open-source code release

**What You Bring:**
• PhD in Power Systems, Controls, or Applied Machine Learning
• 3+ years experience with utility data systems (PI/SCADA, MQTT, IEC 61850)
• Strong Python/MATLAB skills; hands-on experience with containerization & MLOps
• Familiarity with IEEE-738 or dynamic line rating is a significant asset
• Excellent documentation and stakeholder communication skills

**Why Join Us:**
• Direct industry partnership with NB Power
• Access to UNB's Smart Grid Lab and real operational data
• Professional development including IEEE PES tutorials and UNB micro-credentials
• Pathway to leadership roles in Atlantic Canada's growing clean-energy sector

📧 **To Apply:** Send your CV and a brief statement of interest to jcardena@unb.ca

### Postdoctoral Research Professional Position
**Real-Time Dynamic Thermal Rating & DER-Analytics Platform**

**Location:** University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada  
**Duration:** 12 months (January 5, 2026 – December 31, 2026)  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Julian Cardenas Barrera (with co-supervision by Dr. Liuchen Chang)

#### About the Position

The Emera & NB Power Research Center for Smart Grid Technologies at UNB invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Professional to lead the development, testing, and operationalization of a Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) and DER-analytics platform in partnership with NB Power.

This position is funded by ResearchNB's Research Professional Fund and offers a unique opportunity to advance technology from TRL 5 to TRL 7 while working directly with utility engineers and operational systems.

#### Project Overview

New Brunswick's energy strategy calls for a five-fold increase in wind and solar capacity by 2035. This project addresses a critical barrier: the stress on aging transmission infrastructure from rapid DER growth. Dynamic Thermal Rating can unlock 15–30% additional capacity on existing lines when weather conditions permit, reducing renewable curtailment and deferring costly grid rebuilds.

You will convert an existing academic prototype into a robust, production-ready solution integrated with NB Power's operational systems.

#### Key Responsibilities

**Research & Development (60%)**
- Enhance conductor-temperature models by integrating finite-element thermal physics with LSTM-based weather nowcasting
- Implement continuous verification against reference sensors with automated fallbacks
- Target temperature prediction MAE ≤7°C

**Software Engineering**
- Refactor prototype code into modular micro-services
- Implement full CI/CD pipeline on UNB GitLab
- Deploy containerized services on NB Power's on-premises Kubernetes cluster
- Ensure system uptime ≥95% during pilot operations

**Pilot Deployment**
- Configure secure MQTT data feeds from field sensors
- Conduct 3-month live trials on two 138 kV transmission corridors
- Develop explainability dashboards and operator alarms

**Knowledge Transfer & Mentorship (40%)**
- Co-supervise 2 MSc and 2 BEng capstone students
- Lead workshops for NB Power engineers and provincial DER developers
- Publish code under Apache 2.0 open-source license
- Contribute to NB Energy Futures white-paper

#### Required Qualifications

- PhD in Power Systems, Electrical Engineering, Controls, or Applied Machine Learning
- Minimum 3 years experience with utility data systems
- Proficiency in Python and MATLAB
- Hands-on experience with:
  - CI/CD pipelines and version control (Git)
  - Time-series data processing and MLOps
  - PI/SCADA integration
  - Containerized deployment (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Strong technical documentation and training skills
- Demonstrated ability to mentor students

#### Preferred Qualifications

- Experience with dynamic line rating or conductor thermal modeling
- Familiarity with IEEE-738 standard for conductor thermal ratings
- Knowledge of IEC 62351 (power system cybersecurity) and IEC 61850/MMS
- Track record of delivering production services in regulated/utility environments

#### What We Offer

- Competitive salary with benefits
- Access to UNB Smart Grid Lab (servers, MATLAB/COMSOL licenses)
- Direct collaboration with NB Power's transmission planning team
- Professional development opportunities:
  - IEEE PES tutorial attendance
  - NB Innovation Week participation
  - UNB "Project Management for Researchers" micro-credential
- Pathway to leadership roles in Atlantic Canada's clean-energy sector

#### Application Process

Interested candidates should submit:
1. Current CV
2. Brief statement of research interests and relevant experience (1–2 pages)
3. Contact information for 2–3 references

**Submit to:** Dr. Julian Cardenas Barrera at jcardena@unb.ca

**Application Deadline:** Open until filled; review begins February 2026

#### About the Research Group

The Emera & NB Power Research Center for Smart Grid Technologies conducts industry-focused research on power systems optimization, renewable energy integration, and distributed energy resources. Our work is supported by the $8.4M Atlantic Digital Grid consortium and direct partnerships with utilities across Atlantic Canada.
